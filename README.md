PLANET MINECRAFT: https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/pvp-arena-5085442/


Hi. My name is HAWGaming. I am Command Block coder, and Speedrunner, all in all a Technical Player.
I made this pvp arena involving a lot of feature:

- Loading Animation
- Particle Effect
- Ready for fight option
- Fight Starts animation
- Teleportation

Also I Desorated the interiors. I has spend 10+ hour to finish it. It is a 1v1 arena, what can be used up to 4v4 players.

Always Hit clear inventory before fight, and before you press the "Gear" button you must scroll to the first hotbar slot, to make it work.

Use survival or Adventure Mode, Dont Mine Or Destroy or you gonna have problems. Also the map for Java 1.16.4.
